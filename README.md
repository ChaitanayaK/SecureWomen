# **SecureWomen**  
*A Data-Driven Risk Assessment for Women's Safety*  

## **Project Overview**  
SecureWomen is a research-based project designed to assess personal safety in various environments using data-driven risk analysis. By leveraging **survey responses, Monte Carlo simulations, and location-based metrics**, this project identifies key risk factors and proposes a real-world safety intervention system.  

## **Research Methodology**  
- Collected **200 survey responses** to determine five key risk factors:  
  1. **Time of day**  
  2. **Number of people nearby**  
  3. **Distance from the nearest police station**  
  4. **Distance from a populated area**  
  5. **Distance from the individual’s home**  
- Developed a **weighted risk scoring system** to quantify the total risk.  
- Used **Monte Carlo Simulation** with **10,000 iterations** to generate a normal risk distribution, identifying a mean risk value of **7.17119**.  
- Proposed a real-world application where an automated alert system could notify individuals when their risk exceeds the threshold.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For data analysis and visualization.  
- **Pandas** – To process and analyze survey data.  
- **Google Maps API** – For location-based risk factor evaluation.  
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Services** – To determine proximity-based safety insights.  

## **Potential Real-World Applications**  
- **Automated Alert System:** Could integrate with **Twilio API** to notify individuals or emergency contacts when risk levels rise.  
- **Safety Navigation Assistance:** Can help suggest safer routes based on risk analysis.  
- **Personalized Risk Monitoring:** Users could assess their safety dynamically based on changing conditions.  

## **Conclusion**  
SecureWomen provides a **data-driven approach** to assessing personal safety, demonstrating a **correlation between increasing risk levels and emergency call frequency**. The project serves as a foundation for developing technological solutions aimed at improving **women's safety in India**.
